here is a a list of the things i want to complete on this project

- [x] there is a problem with setting the root password using a external file

- [x] stop using this annoying https://github.com/deluan/zsh-in-docker, take the good parts and make it modular so that to have two separate files zsh\*plugins & zshrc_extra

- [ ] make the docker file more modular, i hate that everything in one single long file, here is some ideas

1. make the process of creating the users and configuring passwords in separate file
2. make the installation of packages in it's own separate file
3. make the process of getting zsh ready also it's own separate file
